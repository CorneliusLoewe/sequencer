# We GOT it!!

As it turns out it was a lot easier to obtain the library than we thought.
So far the calculated sequences look good and will definitely help with our research.


You can calculate the seeds we obtained like this

```ruby
require 'elssequencer'

sequence = Elssequencer::Sequence.new 'seed'

puts sequence.calculate
```

Something is weird about the seed `xiZcnemsklj28smndHd`. I'm not sure what that is about, though.
